                <h3>The aim of the TrAM project was to develop a zero emission fast going passenger vessel<br>
                    through advanced modular production. New manufacturing methods can contribute to 25<br>
                    per cent lower production costs and 70 per cent lower engineering costs. The project was<br>
                    revolutionary both in terms of zero emission technology and manufacturing methods, and<br>
                    will contribute to making electric-powered high-speed vessels competitive in terms of<br>
                    both cost and the environment in the future. The TrAM project vessel Medstraum is<br>
                    currently in operation for Kolumbus in Stavanger, Norway.</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>The project developed a toolkit of methods and software tools to be used by the industry when designing and<br>
                    constructing inshore vessels. By combining advanced modular production principles with ship design and<br>
                    construction methods, the project allowed deeper modular system integration than the currently much used<br>
                    one-dimensional modularity systems. The project has made it possible to reuse a broad set of designs and ship<br>
                    system components across the presently envisaged (and other) application cases, while customizing the vessel<br>
                    as necessary for the use case. This allows cost-efficient design and production of one-off designs,of small<br>
                    series, as well as larger series of vessels.

                    <br>
                    The demonstrator vessel Medstraum is built and in operation on a multi-stop commuter route into Stavanger,<br>
                    Norway. The demonstrator is a fully electric fast passenger ferry with zero emission to air and sea.The project<br>
                    also conducted two studies for the same type of vessel in River Thames, London and on the canals in Belgium<br>
                    to explore opportunities for similar zero emission vessels. The TrAM project will continue to pav the way for<br>
                    lower priced, environmentally friendly ships also in other routes in Europe.<br>
